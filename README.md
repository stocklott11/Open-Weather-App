# Overview

I created this project to get hands-on experience with JavaScript by building something practical and interactive. This Weather Forecast App lets users search for current conditions and a five-day forecast by city or ZIP code. It also includes favorites, so you can quickly check your go-to locations.

My goal was to learn more about how JavaScript works with APIs, handles asynchronous code, and updates the web page dynamically. I also experimented with modern JavaScript features and libraries like Day.js and Chart.js to make the app more useful and polished.
